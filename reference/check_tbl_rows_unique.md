# Check model data rows are all unique

Checks that combinations of task ID, output type and output type ID
value combinations are unique, by checking that there are no duplicate
rows across all `tbl` columns excluding the `value` column.

## Usage

``` r
check_tbl_rows_unique(tbl, file_path, hub_path)
```

## Arguments

- tbl:

  a tibble/data.frame of the contents of the file being validated.
  Column types must **all be character**.

- file_path:

  character string. Path to the file being validated relative to the
  hub's model-output directory.

- hub_path:

  Either a character string path to a local Modeling Hub directory or an
  object of class `<SubTreeFileSystem>` created using functions
  [`s3_bucket()`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/s3_bucket.html)
  or
  [`gs_bucket()`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/gs_bucket.html)
  by providing a string S3 or GCS bucket name or path to a Modeling Hub
  directory stored in the cloud. For more details consult the [Using
  cloud storage (S3,
  GCS)](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html) in the `arrow`
  package. The hub must be fully configured with valid `admin.json` and
  `tasks.json` files within the `hub-config` directory.

## Value

Depending on whether validation has succeeded, one of:

- `<message/check_success>` condition class object.

- `<error/check_failure>` condition class object.

Returned object also inherits from subclass `<hub_check>`.
