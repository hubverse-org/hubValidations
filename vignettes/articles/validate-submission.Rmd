## Validating model output files with `validate_submission()`

While most hubs will have automated validation systems set up to check contributions during submission, `hubValidations` also provides functionality for validating files locally before submitting them.

For this, **submitting teams can use `validate_submission()` to validate their model output files prior to submitting.**

The function takes a relative path, relative to the model output directory, as argument `file_path`, performs a series of standard validation checks and returns their results in the form of a `hub_validations` S3 class object.

```{r}
hub_path <- system.file("testhubs/simple", package = "hubValidations")

validate_submission(hub_path,
  file_path = "team1-goodmodel/2022-10-08-team1-goodmodel.csv"
)
```

For more details on the structure of `<hub_validations>` objects, including how to access more information on individual checks, see `vignette("hub-validations-class")`.

### Validation early return

**Some checks which are critical to downstream checks will cause validation to stop and return the results of the checks up to and including the critical check that failed early.**

They generally return a `<error/check_error>` condition class object.
Any problems identified will need to be resolved and the function re-run for validation to proceed further.


```{r}
hub_path <- system.file("testhubs/simple", package = "hubValidations")

validate_submission(hub_path,
  file_path = "team1-goodmodel/2022-10-15-hub-baseline.csv"
)
```

### Execution Errors

If an execution error occurs in any of the checks, an `<error/check_exec_error>` is returned instead. For validation purposes, this results in the same downstream effects as an `<error/check_error>` object.


### Checking for errors with `check_for_errors()`

You can check whether your file will overall pass validation checks by passing the `hub_validations` object to `check_for_errors()`. 

If validation fails, an error will be thrown and the failing checks will be summarised.

```{r, error=TRUE}
validate_submission(hub_path,
  file_path = "team1-goodmodel/2022-10-08-team1-goodmodel.csv"
) %>%
  check_for_errors()
```



### Skipping the submission window check

If you are preparing your submission prior to the submission window opening, you might want to skip the submission window check.
You can so by setting argument `skip_submit_window_check` to `TRUE`. 

This results in the previous valid file (except for failing the validation window check) now passing overall validation.

```{r}
validate_submission(hub_path,
  file_path = "team1-goodmodel/2022-10-08-team1-goodmodel.csv",
  skip_submit_window_check = TRUE
) %>%
  check_for_errors()
```

### Ignoring derived task IDs to improve validation performance

Argument **`derived_task_ids`** allows for the specification of **task IDs that are derived from other task IDs** to be ignored, which **can often lead to a significant improvement in validation performance**.

#### What are derived task IDs?

Derived task IDs are a class of task ID whose values depend on the values of other task IDs. As such, the **validity of derived task ID values is dependent on the values of the task IDs they are derived from** and the validity of value combinations of derived and other task IDs is much more restricted. A common example of a derived task ID is `target_end_date` which is most often derived from the `reference_date` or `origin_date` and `horizon` task ids. 

#### Implications of derived task IDs on validation performance

With standard validation, derived task IDs like `target_end_date` tend to pollute the expanded grid used to validate valid value combination with invalid combinations. That's because, while a given combination of `reference_date` and `horizon` values will only have a single valid `target_end_date` value, the `target_end_date` property in the config will contain all possible valid values for all combinations of `reference_date` and `horizon`. Because its the values in the config used to create the expanded valid values grid, the sizes these grids can reach as function of config complexity can often put excessive strain on the system's memory, affecting overall performance of submission validation. 

#### How to ignore derived task IDs

Supplying the names of derived task IDs to argument `derived_task_ids` will ignore them during validation checks and, depending on config complexity, this **can lead to a significant improvement in validation performance**.


### `validate_submission` check details

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
arrow::read_csv_arrow(system.file("check_table.csv", package = "hubValidations")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    .data$`parent fun` != "validate_model_metadata",
    !.data$optional
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-"parent fun", -"check fun", -"optional") %>%
  dplyr::mutate("Extra info" = dplyr::case_when(
    is.na(.data$`Extra info`) ~ "",
    TRUE ~ .data$`Extra info`
  )) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Details of checks performed by `validate_submission()`") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```


## Validating model metadata files with `validate_model_metadata()`

If you want to check a model metadata file before submitting, you can similarly use function `validate_model_metadata()`.

The function takes model metadata file name as argument `file_path`, performs a series of validation checks and returns their results in the form of a `hub_validations` S3 class object.

```{r}
validate_model_metadata(hub_path,
  file_path = "hub-baseline.yml"
)

validate_model_metadata(hub_path,
  file_path = "team1-goodmodel.yaml"
)
```

### `validate_model_metadata` check details

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(kableExtra)
arrow::read_csv_arrow(system.file("check_table.csv", package = "hubValidations")) %>%
  dplyr::filter(
    .data$`parent fun` == "validate_model_metadata",
    !.data$optional
  ) %>%
  dplyr::select(-"parent fun", -"check fun", -"optional") %>%
  dplyr::mutate("Extra info" = dplyr::case_when(
    is.na(.data$`Extra info`) ~ "",
    TRUE ~ .data$`Extra info`
  )) %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Details of checks performed by `validate_model_metadata()`") %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) %>%
  column_spec(1, bold = TRUE)
```

#### Custom checks

The standard checks discussed here are the checks deployed by default by the `validate_submission` or `validate_model_metadata` functions. 
For more information on deploying optional/custom functions or functions that require configuration please check the article on [including custom functions](articles/custom-functions.html) (`vignette("custom-functions")`).
