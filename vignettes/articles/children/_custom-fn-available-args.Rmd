Each of the `validate_*()` functions contain a number of standard objects in their call environment which are passed automatically to arguments with the same name and therefore do not need including but can be overridden through a function's `args` configuration during deployment. 

The exact set of objects available to arguments depend on `validate_*()` calling function:

- **`validate_model_file`:**
  - `file_path`: character string of path to file being validated relative to the `model-output` directory.
  - `hub_path`: character string of path to hub.
  - `round_id`: character string of `round_id`
  - `file_meta`: named list containing `round_id`, `team_abbr`, `model_abbr` and `model_id` details.
- **`validate_model_data`:** 
  - `tbl`: a tibble of the model output data being validated.
  - `tbl_chr`: a tibble of the model output data being validated with all columns coerced to character type.
  - `file_path`: character string of path to file being validated relative to the `model-output` directory.
  - `hub_path`: character string of path to hub.
  - `round_id`: character string of `round_id`
  - `file_meta`: named list containing `round_id`, `team_abbr`, `model_abbr` and `model_id` details.
  - `round_id_col`: character string of name of `tbl` column containing `round_id` information.
  - `output_type_id_datatype`: character string. The value of the `output_type_id_datatype` argument. This value is useful in functions like `hubData::create_hub_schema()` or `hubValidations::expand_model_out_grid()` to set the data type of `output_type_id` column.
  - `derived_task_ids`: character vector or `NULL`. The value of the `derived_task_ids` argument, i.e. the names of task IDs whose values depend on other task IDs.
- **`validate_model_metadata`:** 
  - `file_path`: character string of path to file being validated relative to the `model-output` directory.
  - `hub_path`: character string of path to hub.
  - `round_id`: character string of `round_id`
  - `file_meta`: named list containing `round_id`, `team_abbr`, `model_abbr` and `model_id` details.

The `args` configuration can be used to override objects from the caller environment as well as defaults during deployment.
