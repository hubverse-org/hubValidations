\usage{
check_submission_time(
  hub_path,
  file_path,
  ref_date_from = c("file", "file_path")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hub_path}{Either a character string path to a local Modeling Hub directory
or an object of class \verb{<SubTreeFileSystem>} created using functions \code{\link[hubData:s3_bucket]{s3_bucket()}}
or \code{\link[hubData:gs_bucket]{gs_bucket()}} by providing a string S3 or GCS bucket name or path to a
Modeling Hub directory stored in the cloud.
For more details consult the
\href{https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html}{Using cloud storage (S3, GCS)}
in the \code{arrow} package.
The hub must be fully configured with valid \code{admin.json} and \code{tasks.json}
files within the \code{hub-config} directory.}

\item{file_path}{character string. Path to the file being validated relative to
the hub's model-output directory.}

\item{ref_date_from}{whether to get the reference date around
which relative submission windows will be determined from the file's
\code{file_path} round ID or the \code{file} contents themselves.
\code{file} requires that the file can be read.
Only applicable when a round is configured to determine the submission
windows relative to the value in a date column in model output files.
Not applicable when explicit submission window start and end dates are
provided in the hub's config.}
}
\value{
Depending on whether validation has succeeded, one of:
\itemize{
\item \verb{<message/check_success>} condition class object.
\item \verb{<error/check_failure>} condition class object.
}

Returned object also inherits from subclass \verb{<hub_check>}.
