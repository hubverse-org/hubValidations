\title{Check that any round_id_col name provided or extracted from the hub config is
valid.}
\usage{
check_valid_round_id_col(tbl, file_path, hub_path, round_id_col = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{a tibble/data.frame of the contents of the file being validated.}

\item{file_path}{character string. Path to the file being validated relative to
the hub's model-output directory.}

\item{hub_path}{Either a character string path to a local Modeling Hub directory
or an object of class \verb{<SubTreeFileSystem>} created using functions \code{\link[hubData:s3_bucket]{s3_bucket()}}
or \code{\link[hubData:gs_bucket]{gs_bucket()}} by providing a string S3 or GCS bucket name or path to a
Modeling Hub directory stored in the cloud.
For more details consult the
\href{https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html}{Using cloud storage (S3, GCS)}
in the \code{arrow} package.
The hub must be fully configured with valid \code{admin.json} and \code{tasks.json}
files within the \code{hub-config} directory.}

\item{round_id_col}{Character string. The name of the column containing
\code{round_id}s. Usually, the value of round property \code{round_id} in hub \code{tasks.json}
config file.}
}
\value{
Depending on whether validation has succeeded, one of:
\itemize{
\item \verb{<message/check_success>} condition class object.
\item \verb{<error/check_failure>} condition class object.
}

If \code{round_id_from_variable: false} and no \code{round_id_col} name is provided,
check is skipped and a \verb{<message/check_info>} condition class object is
returned.
Returned object also inherits from subclass \verb{<hub_check>}.
}
\description{
Check that any round_id_col name provided or extracted from the hub config is
valid.
}
\details{
This check only applies to files being submitted to rounds where
\code{round_id_from_variable: true} or where a \code{round_id_col} name is explicitly
provided. Skipped otherwise.
}
