\title{Capture a validation warning condition}
\usage{
capture_validation_warning(msg, where = NULL, call = rlang::caller_call(), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{msg}{Character string. The warning message. Accepts text that can be
interpreted and formatted by \code{\link[cli:format_inline]{cli::format_inline()}}.}

\item{where}{Optional. Character string indicating the location or context
of the warning (e.g., file path, \code{"hub-config"}). Used as metadata.}

\item{call}{The defused call of the function that generated the warning.
Use to override default which uses the caller call. See \link[rlang:stack]{rlang::stack}
for more details.}

\item{...}{Additional named fields to include in the warning condition object.
Useful for attaching structured data (e.g., \code{config_files = c("tasks.json")}).}
}
\value{
A \verb{<warning/validation_warning>} condition class object.
}
\description{
Capture a warning about the validation process. Unlike check results
(success/failure/error), validation warnings are informational messages
about the validation process itself rather than validation outcomes.
}
\details{
Validation warnings can be attached at two levels:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Validation-level}: Stored as an attribute on \code{hub_validations} objects,
printed prominently by default.
\item \strong{Check-level}: Stored in a \code{warnings} field on individual check results,
printed only when \code{verbose = TRUE}.
}
}
\examples{
# Simple warning
capture_validation_warning(
  msg = "Configuration files were modified"
)

# Warning with location and additional structured data
config_files <- c("tasks.json", "admin.json")
capture_validation_warning(
  msg = "Config files modified: {.path {config_files}}",
  where = "hub-config",
  config_files = config_files
)
}
