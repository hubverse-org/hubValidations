\title{Check model output data tbl samples contain the appropriate number of samples
for a given compound idx.}
\usage{
check_tbl_spl_n(tbl, round_id, file_path, hub_path, compound_taskid_set = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{tbl}{a tibble/data.frame of the contents of the file being validated. Column types must \strong{all be character}.}

\item{round_id}{character string. The round identifier.}

\item{file_path}{character string. Path to the file being validated relative to
the hub's model-output directory.}

\item{hub_path}{Either a character string path to a local Modeling Hub directory
or an object of class \verb{<SubTreeFileSystem>} created using functions \code{\link[hubData:s3_bucket]{s3_bucket()}}
or \code{\link[hubData:gs_bucket]{gs_bucket()}} by providing a string S3 or GCS bucket name or path to a
Modeling Hub directory stored in the cloud.
For more details consult the
\href{https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html}{Using cloud storage (S3, GCS)}
in the \code{arrow} package.
The hub must be fully configured with valid \code{admin.json} and \code{tasks.json}
files within the \code{hub-config} directory.}

\item{compound_taskid_set}{a list of \code{compound_taskid_set}s (characters vector of compound task IDs),
one for each modeling task. Used to override the compound task ID set in the config file,
for example, when validating coarser samples.}
}
\value{
Depending on whether validation has succeeded, one of:
\itemize{
\item \verb{<message/check_success>} condition class object.
\item \verb{<warning/check_failure>} condition class object.
}

Returned object also inherits from subclass \verb{<hub_check>}.
}
\description{
Check model output data tbl samples contain the appropriate number of samples
for a given compound idx.
}
\details{
Output of the check includes an \code{errors} element, a list of items,
one for each compound_idx failing validation, with the following structure:
\itemize{
\item \code{compound_idx}: the compound idx that failed validation of number of samples.
\item \code{n}: the number of samples counted for the compound idx.
\item \code{min_samples_per_task}: the minimum number of samples required for the compound idx.
\item \code{max_samples_per_task}: the maximum number of samples required for the compound idx.
\item \code{compound_idx_tbl}: a tibble of the expected structure for samples belonging to
the compound idx.
See \href{https://hubverse.io/en/latest/user-guide/sample-output-type.html}{hubverse documentation on samples}
for more details.
