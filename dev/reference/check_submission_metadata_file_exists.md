check_submission_metadata_file_exists(file_path, hub_path = ".")
```

  character string. Path to the file being validated relative to the
  hub's model-output directory.

  Either a character string path to a local Modeling Hub directory or an
  object of class `<SubTreeFileSystem>` created using functions

  or
  [`gs_bucket()`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/reference/gs_bucket.html)
  by providing a string S3 or GCS bucket name or path to a Modeling Hub
  directory stored in the cloud. For more details consult the [Using
  cloud storage (S3,
  GCS)](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/r/articles/fs.html) in the `arrow`
